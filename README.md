### Challenges

I faced several challenges throughout this project:

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Creating clean, responsive UI layouts was difficult at first. Ensuring spacing, scaling, and component alignment worked well across screen sizes required multiple iterations.

2. **Progress Bar & Rating Bar Logic**
   - Building the interactive rating bars and progress bars took time. Making them visually consistent, dynamic, and accurately tied to the data involved careful frontend logic and styling.

3. **Using LocalStorage**
   - I had never used `localStorage` before to store user-generated content. Learning how to persist reviews, update them dynamically, and keep the UI synced with saved data was a new and valuable challenge.
